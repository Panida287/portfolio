                        This was my first design assignment which I used throughout my HTML, CSS and Javascript assignments with a
                        little bit of adjustments due to limitation of my skill at the time. But I want to keep
                        improving it.

                        SquareEyes is a video streaming website that I chose out of 3 choices, which were:
                        <li>
                            SquareEyes - Video Streaming service
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            GameHub - Online Game store
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            RainyDay - Clothing store
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        chose SquareEyes because I feel like it is the service I use the most and it is the most
                        challenging to design in my opinion.

                        This project was part of my semester project that requires us to make a science museum website
                        that appeal to children and their parents.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        This was the first project that I collaborate with two of my classmates:
                        <li>
                            Helene Flått
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aksel Oldeide
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We came up with the idea of Matter Museum that have exhibitions of all matters, solid, liquid,
                        gas and plasma.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We designed it to be colourful as well as informative to appeal to both kids and parents.
                        With this project, we learned to work on different branches and work on merge conflicts. No
                        JavaScript was used in this project

                        This project was part of Agency 1. We were free to choose any project we want. We came up with
                        photography service because I happen to have some contents we can use for it and I might end up
                        using this website in future for my side gig.

                    <p>
                        I was the project manager in this project as well as designer, could say that I am also a client because I get to dictate how the website should be like.

                        Since this was more people on the team this time, it was more challenging to follow up and meet up to share up dates and working with different coding styles. But it was fun and I learned a lot to work as a team and be understanding.
